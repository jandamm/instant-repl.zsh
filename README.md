# instant-repl.zsh
Activate a REPL for any command in your current zsh session.

This plugin is very lightweight. It's source code is shorter than this readme :)
It does not add any keybindings. It's up to you to choose the bindings. If you don't have any preferences or feel overwhelmed by this customization options, just stick to the **Example**.

## Motivation
I started using [gitsh](https://github.com/thoughtbot/gitsh) a while ago and really liked to quickly navigate git.
But the more I configured zsh the less fun it was to use `gitsh`.
It lacked some completions, the prompt is way less configurable and using [fzf-tab](https://github.com/Aloxaf/fzf-tab) also feels way better than completion of `readline`.

I jotted down what I'd need of zsh to be satisfied:
1. Interpret every command as a `git` command
2. Empty prompt is a default command (`git status`)
3. Prompt showing the current git status

The second and third point aren't a real problem.

For the first point I've written this plugin.

See my [dotfiles](https://github.com/jandamm/dotfiles/tree/master/zsh) for an implementation.

See **Hints** for a short description.

## Installation
See example below for more configuration

### [zinit](https://github.com/zdharma/zinit)
```zsh
zinit light jandamm/instant-repl.zsh

# This binds setting the REPL to Control-O
# You can use this plugin without keybindings if you prefer.
bindkey '^o' repl-set
```

### manual
- Clone and source `instant-repl.zsh`.
- Set a key binding for `repl-set`: `bindkey '^o' repl-set`

## Usage
You have two ways to use this:

### Keybinding

- Type a command. (e.g. `git `)
- Press the assigned keystroke. (e.g. `control-o`)
- Then your in the REPL mode.
- To exit the REPL clear the prompt and press the keystroke again.

### By script/command

Set the variable `INSTANT_REPL_PREFIX` to your REPL command. (e.g. `git `)

## Example

```zsh
zinit light jandamm/instant-repl.zsh

bindkey '^o' repl-set
# bindkey '^u' repl-backward-kill-line
bindkey '^u' repl-kill-whole-line # zsh default
# bindkey '^u' repl-kill-whole-line-toggle # zsh default, restores prefix when pressing with empty prompt.
```

## Configuration
Here is a list of all functions you can bind keys to and variables to change the plugins behavior.

Everything that is not listed here is considered implementation detail and should be treated as such.

### ZLE functions
You can use these functions with `bindkey [key] {function}`.
In functions you call from your own key binding functions you can use them like this: `zle {function}`.

Every ZLE function is also provided as function with the prefix `_instant_repl::`.
So calling `repl-set` from a script is possible via `_instant_repl::repl-set`.

#### repl-set
Sets the current prompt content to use for REPL mode.

#### repl-clear
Clears the REPL mode for the next prompt.

#### repl-backward-kill-line
Changes backward-kill-line (bash `^u`) to kill the line except the REPL. If only the REPL exists it clears the line.

This can be used as a drop in replacement for backward-kill-line.

#### repl-backward-kill-line-toggle
See `repl-backward-kill-line`. When the prompt is empty this function will set the prompt to the prefix.

#### repl-kill-whole-line
Changes kill-whole-line (bash `^u`) to kill the line except the REPL. If only the REPL exists it clears the line.

This can be used as a drop in replacement for kill-whole-line.

#### repl-kill-whole-line-toggle
See `repl-kill-whole-line`. When the prompt is empty this function will set the prompt to the prefix.

#### repl-redraw-prompt
This zle function calls every precmd and then resets the prompt.
Use this if you want to update the prompt for certain prefixes.

### Variables
#### INSTANT_REPL_NO_AUTOFIX
By default there is exactly one space after the REPL when set via `repl-set`. If set, this behavior is disabled.

#### INSTANT_REPL_PREFIX
Represents the current REPL command.

## Hints
While it is nice to write some commands quicker, you can do more with it.

As stated in **Motivation** I wanted to replace `gitsh` with this plugin.

I call it `gsh` and for this I'm wrapping `repl-set` into another zle function:
```zsh
function repl-set-with-gsh() {
	# Check if I'm currently using git in INSTANT_REPL_PREFIX
	zle repl-set
	if [ using_git ] && [ ! was_using_git ]; then
		gsh_setup
		zle repl-redraw-prompt
	elif [ was_using_git ]; then
		gsh_unset
		zle repl-redraw-prompt
	fi
}
```

I also use a script to *start* gsh:
```zsh
INSTANT_REPL_PREFIX='git '
gsh_setup
```
